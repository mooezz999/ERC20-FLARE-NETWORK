# Sample Hardhat Project

In this project I'm deploying an ERC20 token to the flare network testnet called cston2 which is known for its interoperability and low gas fees.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
